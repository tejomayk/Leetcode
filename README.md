# Leetcode
I want to become a better engineer. I think it will be good to improve my problem solving skills. Leetcode seems to be a good way to go about that.

Each folder under `\src` contains the following two files: 
1.  `solution.py` which contains my latest solution to the problem
2. `notes.md` which contains the problem statement along with any thoughts or revision notes I took down while iterating over the solution

Going through the commit history will help me reflect upon the evolution of my thought process.
